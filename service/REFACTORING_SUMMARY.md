# File Set Deletion Service Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Path Construction (Completed ✓)

**File**: `service/src/view_models.rs`

Added two helper methods to the `Settings` struct to centralize path construction logic:

```rust
impl Settings {
    /// Get the path to a specific file type directory within the collection root
    pub fn get_file_type_path(&self, file_type: &FileType) -> PathBuf;

    /// Get the full path to a specific file within the collection
    /// Automatically appends the .zst extension to the archive_file_name
    pub fn get_file_path(&self, file_type: &FileType, archive_file_name: &str) -> PathBuf;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Path construction logic is centralized in one place
- `.zst` extension is automatically handled
- Easier to test with temporary directories
- Reduced code duplication across services

**Files Updated**:
- `file_set_deletion_service.rs` - Now uses `settings.get_file_path()`
- `cloud_storage_sync_service.rs` - Now uses `settings.get_file_path()`

### 2. File System Operations Trait (Completed ✓)

**File**: `service/src/file_system_ops.rs` (NEW)

Created a trait-based abstraction for file system operations:

```rust
pub trait FileSystemOps: Send + Sync {
    fn exists(&self, path: &Path) -> bool;
    fn remove_file(&self, path: &Path) -> io::Result<()>;
}
```

**Implementations**:
- `StdFileSystemOps` - Production implementation using `std::fs`
- `MockFileSystemOps` - Test implementation (only available in test builds)

**Why Send + Sync?**
- `Send` - The implementation can be moved between threads (required for `Arc<F>`)
- `Sync` - The implementation can be shared between threads via `&self` (required for async/Tokio)

**Mock Features**:
- `add_file(path)` - Add files to the mock file system
- `fail_delete_with(error)` - Simulate deletion failures  
- `get_deleted_files()` - Get list of deleted files
- `was_deleted(path)` - Check if a specific file was deleted
- `clear()` - Reset mock state between tests

**Service Changes**:

```rust
// Before
pub struct FileSetDeletionService {
    repository_manager: Arc<RepositoryManager>,
    settings: Arc<Settings>,
}

// After (modularized into file_set_deletion/ directory)
pub struct FileSetDeletionService<F: FileSystemOps = StdFileSystemOps> {
    repository_manager: Arc<RepositoryManager>,
    settings: Arc<Settings>,
    fs_ops: Arc<F>,
}
```

### 3. Modular Structure (Completed ✓)

**Directory**: `service/src/file_set_deletion/` (NEW)

Split the monolithic file into separate modules:

```
file_set_deletion/
├── mod.rs        - Module exports
├── context.rs    - DeletionContext and FileDeletionResult  
├── service.rs    - FileSetDeletionService implementation
├── executor.rs   - DeletionPipeline executor
└── steps.rs      - All 6 pipeline step implementations
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier to navigate and understand
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Tests are organized by module
- Easier to find and modify specific steps

### 4. Hybrid Pipeline Pattern (Completed ✓)

**Key Change**: Step return type changed from `Result<StepAction, Error>` to just `StepAction`

```rust
// Before
async fn execute(&self, context: &mut DeletionContext<F>) -> Result<StepAction, Error>;

// After  
async fn execute(&self, context: &mut DeletionContext<F>) -> StepAction;
```

Errors are now returned as `StepAction::Abort(Error)` instead of `Err(e)`. This is cleaner and more explicit about the control flow.

**Pipeline Steps** (in execution order):
1. ValidateNotInUseStep
2. FetchFileInfosStep
3. DeleteFileSetStep (moved earlier to handle foreign keys)
4. FilterDeletableFilesStep
5. MarkForCloudDeletionStep
6. DeleteLocalFilesStep

**Context Structure**:
- Uses `HashMap<Vec<u8>, FileDeletionResult>` keyed by SHA1 checksum
- Tracks detailed state per file: deletability, cloud sync status, deletion success, errors
- Accumulates results as pipeline progresses

### 5. Database Migration (Completed ✓)

**File**: `database/migrations/20251018200839_file_info_system_on_delete_cascade.sql` (NEW)

Added `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `file_info_system` table:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;

ALTER TABLE file_info_system RENAME TO file_info_system_old;

CREATE TABLE file_info_system (
    file_info_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    system_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (file_info_id, system_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (file_info_id) REFERENCES file_info(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (system_id) REFERENCES system(id)
);

INSERT INTO file_info_system (file_info_id, system_id)
SELECT file_info_id, system_id FROM file_info_system_old;

DROP TABLE file_info_system_old;

PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

**Why This Was Needed**:
- Without `ON DELETE CASCADE`, deleting a `file_info` would fail with foreign key constraint error
- The `file_info_system` entries would prevent file_info deletion
- Now when a file_info is deleted, related file_info_system entries are automatically removed

**Important**: When modifying migrations, you must clear the sqlx cache:
```bash
rm -rf .sqlx database/.sqlx
cargo test
```

### 6. Tests (Completed ✓)

Added comprehensive tests for each pipeline step:

**Test Structure**:
- `test_validate_not_in_use_step` - Tests validation logic
- `test_fetch_file_infos_step` - Tests file info fetching
- `test_filter_deletable_files_step` - Tests filtering logic
- `test_mark_for_cloud_deletion_step` - Tests cloud sync marking
- `test_delete_local_files_step` - Tests file deletion with mock FS
- `test_delete_file_infos_step` - Tests database cleanup
- `test_delete_file_set` - Integration test

**Mock Usage Example**:
```rust
let mock_fs = Arc::new(MockFileSystemOps::new());
mock_fs.add_file("/collection/rom/game.zst");

let service = FileSetDeletionService::new_with_fs_ops(
    repo_manager,
    settings,
    mock_fs.clone(),
);

service.delete_file_set(file_set_id).await.unwrap();

assert!(mock_fs.was_deleted("/collection/rom/game.zst"));
```

## Testing Guide

To write tests for `FileSetDeletionService`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use crate::file_system_ops::mock::MockFileSystemOps;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_deletes_local_files() {
        // Setup
        let mock_fs = Arc::new(MockFileSystemOps::new());
        mock_fs.add_file("/collection/rom/game.zst");
        
        let service = FileSetDeletionService::new_with_fs_ops(
            repo_manager,  // You'll need to set this up
            settings,      // You'll need to set this up
            mock_fs.clone(),
        );
        
        // Execute
        service.delete_file_set(file_set_id).await.unwrap();
        
        // Verify
        assert!(mock_fs.was_deleted("/collection/rom/game.zst"));
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_handles_deletion_failure() {
        let mock_fs = Arc::new(MockFileSystemOps::new());
        mock_fs.add_file("/collection/rom/game.zst");
        mock_fs.fail_delete_with("Permission denied");
        
        let service = FileSetDeletionService::new_with_fs_ops(
            repo_manager,
            settings,
            mock_fs.clone(),
        );
        
        // Should not panic, just log error
        service.delete_file_set(file_set_id).await.unwrap();
        
        // File should not be deleted
        assert!(!mock_fs.was_deleted("/collection/rom/game.zst"));
    }
}
```


## Remaining Improvement Opportunities

The following could still be improved (lower priority):

### Better Logging

Currently uses `eprintln!` for output. Consider:
- Using `tracing` or `log` crate for structured logging
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Contextual information in logs

### Error Handling Improvements

Could implement `From` trait for cleaner error conversion:

```rust
impl From<DatabaseError> for Error {
    fn from(e: DatabaseError) -> Self {
        Error::DbError(e.to_string())
    }
}
```

This would eliminate `.map_err(|e| Error::DbError(e.to_string()))?` calls.

### Configuration

Make batch sizes and other constants configurable:
- Number of files per batch
- Retry attempts
- Timeout values
