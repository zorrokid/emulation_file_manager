# Mixed Async Runtime Issue

## Overview

This project uses **async-std** as the primary async runtime, but inadvertently includes **tokio** through transitive dependencies. This creates a mixed runtime environment where both runtimes coexist in the same process.

## Current State

### Direct Runtime Usage
- All application code uses `async-std`
- Database layer (`sqlx`) configured with `runtime-async-std` feature
- All `Cargo.toml` files explicitly depend on `async-std`

### Tokio Introduction Path

Tokio is pulled in through the following dependency chain:

```
service
├── http_downloader
│   └── surf v2.3.2
│       └── http-client v6.5.3
│           └── deadpool v0.7.0
│               └── tokio v1.46.1
└── cloud_storage
    └── rust-s3 v0.37.1
        └── surf v2.3.2
            └── (same chain as above)
```

**Key culprit**: `deadpool` (connection pooling library used by surf's http-client) depends on tokio.

### Configuration Attempts

Both `surf` and `rust-s3` are properly configured to use async-std:
- `http_downloader/Cargo.toml`: Uses `surf` with default features
- `cloud_storage/Cargo.toml`: Uses `rust-s3` with `with-async-std` and `async-std-rustls-tls` features

Despite these configurations, tokio still gets pulled in as a transitive dependency.

## Impact

### Observed Effects

1. **Thread naming confusion**: Panic messages show `thread 'tokio-runtime-worker'` even though the code uses async-std
2. **Memory overhead**: Two separate thread pools running (async-std executor + tokio runtime)
3. **Resource usage**: Additional threads and memory for the unused tokio runtime

### Not a Problem

- Does not cause functional bugs (the panic is due to application logic, not runtime mixing)
- Both runtimes can coexist safely in most cases
- No runtime conflicts observed in normal operation

### Potential Risks

1. **Deadlocks**: If code accidentally blocks one runtime while waiting for the other
2. **Confusion**: Debugging becomes harder when stack traces show tokio threads
3. **Resource waste**: Running two runtimes when only one is needed

## Solutions

### Option 1: Accept the Status Quo (Current)
**Pros**: No changes needed, works fine
**Cons**: Wastes some resources, confusing thread names

### Option 2: Switch to Tokio
**Pros**: 
- Most popular runtime in Rust ecosystem
- Better ecosystem support
- Single runtime

**Cons**:
- Requires changing all code to use tokio
- Need to update sqlx to `runtime-tokio-rustls`
- More work to implement

### Option 3: Find Alternative HTTP Libraries
**Pros**: Stay with async-std
**Cons**: 
- Limited options (most HTTP clients use tokio)
- May have other limitations
- Not worth the effort

### Option 4: Wait for Ecosystem Changes
**Pros**: surf/deadpool might eventually drop tokio dependency
**Cons**: No guarantee this will happen, could take years

## Recommendation

**Keep the current setup** unless:
1. The resource overhead becomes measurable performance issue
2. Runtime mixing causes actual bugs (none observed so far)
3. Team decides to standardize on tokio for other reasons

The mixed runtime is a minor inefficiency but not a critical issue. Focus on application logic bugs instead.

## Detection

You can verify the mixed runtime situation with:

```bash
# Check for tokio in dependency tree
cargo tree -p service -i tokio

# Check what depends on tokio
cargo tree -p service 2>&1 | grep -B 10 "tokio"
```
