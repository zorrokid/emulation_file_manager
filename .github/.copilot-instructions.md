# Emulation File Manager - Technical Requirements

## Async Runtime
Use async-std as the async runtime throughout the application.
- All async code uses async-std, not tokio
- Database: SQLx with "runtime-async-std" feature
- Tests: Use #[async_std::test] attribute

## Code Conventions
- Edition: Rust 2024
- No unwrap() in production code (tests OK)
- Prefer ? operator over unwrap/expect
- Pipeline steps in service layer is an exception to use expect when the value is tested in should_execute
- Use descriptive variable names

## Dependencies
When adding crates, prefer:
- async-std over tokio (consistency)
- Well-maintained crates with active development
- Minimal dependency trees
